Trying to create music in command line, using `bash` and `sox`.

Sox allows to [merge audio files with padding](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5587135/sox-merge-two-audio-files-with-a-pad), so in the bash script we can specify which sound file should be played at which time in our track.

Sound files I use are not committed, but are free and can be downloaded from here: https://cymatics.fm/pages/secret-free-download
